The aim of the project is to build a linear model for car fuel consumption. The model is built on the basis of the file "cars.csv", which shows fuel consumption, number of cylinders, engine volume, horsepower, weight, acceleration time, year and place of production for given car models. The OLS model, which has been estimated and tested for assumptions, has been compared with the bootstrap model.
